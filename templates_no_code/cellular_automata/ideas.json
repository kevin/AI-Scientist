        "Title": "Neural Cellular Automata for Real-Time Pollution Tracking and Prediction",
        "Description": "This investigation focuses on applying Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to process real-time environmental data specifically for tracking and predicting pollution spread. The research involves collecting data from environmental sensors and satellite imagery, training the NCA model to recognize patterns and predict how pollutants disperse across different environments. By validating the predictions against historical data, this study aims to demonstrate the potential of NCA in enhancing decision-making processes related to environmental protection and public health.",
