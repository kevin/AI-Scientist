        "Title": "Leveraging Generative Models for Reinforcement Learning in Continual Learning Environments",
        "Description": "This research investigates the integration of generative models with reinforcement learning to enhance continual learning capabilities. By focusing on specific domains such as robotics or autonomous driving, the study will use generative models to simulate new environments and experiences. RL agents can then refine their policies and adapt to new tasks without forgetting previous ones. The framework will explore how generative models can aid in data augmentation and exploration, enabling agents to learn continuously and autonomously. This approach aims to minimize the need for explicit reward signals and reduce catastrophic forgetting, thereby advancing towards AGI.",
