        "Description": "This research will investigate how Japanese banks are culturally and organizationally adapting to digital transformations. By examining existing case studies and conducting interviews with bank employees and managers, the study aims to uncover strategies for effectively integrating digital practices within traditional banking environments. The investigation will explore resistance factors, successful adaptation stories, and the influence of Japanese work culture on these processes. This could lead to arguments on the importance of cultural considerations in digital banking strategies, proposing policy recommendations for smoother transitions.",
