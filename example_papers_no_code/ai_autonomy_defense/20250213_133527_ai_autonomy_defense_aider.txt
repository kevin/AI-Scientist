#### Your goal is to investigate the following idea: Exploring the Role of Autonomous Systems in Japan's Defense Strategies.  
#### The proposed investigation is as follows: This research focuses on the deployment of autonomous systems powered by AI in Japan's defense strategies. It will examine the current applications, challenges, and opportunities of autonomous technologies in military operations. The study will involve an analysis of existing literature, policy documents, and interviews with defense experts. Additionally, it will explore ethical considerations and public perceptions regarding the use of AI-driven autonomous systems in defense. The goal is to provide targeted policy recommendations to enhance the deployment and acceptance of autonomous technologies in Japan's defense framework..  
#### You are given a total of up to 10 research queries to complete the investigation. You do not need to use all 10.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of data objects you would like to gather.  
#### Modify and duplicate the example in `investigation.json` for each query.  
#### Change the `"Description"` field to describe the contents of the `"Data"` object you would like to have.  
#### Change the `"Exists"` and `"Source"` fields to indicate if the data should already exist (e.g., from a prior study or on the internet) or if it needs to be gathered from scratch as during this proposed research.  
#### Change the `"Phase"` and `"Purpose"` fields to explain if it is needed for the proposal justification (e.g., data showing the scale or impact of the problem, examples of similar successful research in other contexts, other statistics), or if it is needed for the actual investigation (can also be existing data or new data collection that needs to be sourced by the researcher but can't be done in just this proposal).  
#### Change the `"Query"` field to a query to search the literature with for the data ONLY if it exists and is needed for the proposal.  
#### Leave the other fields empty.  
#### For example, a data object can be table of yearly historical data, or simply a single fact from an article about the topic.  
#### Objects needed for the proposal should be limited to what can be found on Semantic Scholar, but otherwise you can propose any data object you think would be useful for the investigation.  
#### These will represent the content of your investigation proposal, e.g., for supporting the importance of the topic and for laying out the research plan of the actual investigation if it were to be conducted.  

To plan the list of data objects for the investigation, I will modify and duplicate the example in `investigation.json` for each query. Here are the proposed changes:

\section{Open Questions for Feedback}
\label{sec:questions}

% This paragraph introduces the purpose of the open questions section.
This section aims to highlight unresolved issues and invite constructive feedback from peers to refine the research approach and address potential challenges.

% This paragraph lists methodological tradeoffs and seeks input on them.
One key methodological tradeoff involves balancing the depth of qualitative insights from expert interviews with the breadth of quantitative data from public surveys. How can we ensure that both data types are effectively integrated to provide a comprehensive analysis? Additionally, are there alternative data collection methods that could enhance the robustness of our findings?

% This paragraph discusses ethical dilemmas and seeks guidance on addressing them.
Ethical dilemmas are inherent in the deployment of AI in defense. How can we ensure that our research framework adequately addresses these concerns while aligning with societal values? What ethical guidelines should be prioritized in the context of military applications of AI?

% This paragraph encourages collaboration and invites critique on the proposed framework.
We welcome collaboration with experts in military technology, ethics, and public policy to refine our proposed framework. Are there specific areas within the framework that require further development or adjustment? How can we ensure that our policy recommendations are both actionable and sensitive to the complexities of defense strategies?

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

The integration of AI in military applications has been explored in various studies, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. Szabadföldi (2021) discusses the potential of AI to transform military operations, yet emphasizes the technical and ethical hurdles that remain \citep{szabadfoldi2021military}. Similarly, Pysarenko and Kvasha (2020) examine global technological trends, noting the rapid evolution of military equipment but lacking a focus on specific national strategies \citep{pysarenko2020trends}.

Despite these insights, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the integration of AI-powered autonomous systems specifically within Japan's defense strategies. Previous studies, such as those by Lee (2021) and Sarjito (2024), have addressed AI applications in Northeast Asia but have not delved into the unique challenges and opportunities present in Japan \citep{Lee2021ACS, Sarjito2024EnhancingBA}.

Ethical considerations are another critical aspect often overlooked in existing research. While Surywanshi and Parab (2022) highlight the importance of aligning AI deployment with societal values, comprehensive frameworks that address both technical and ethical dimensions in Japan's context are scarce \citep{Surywanshi2022ArtificialII}. Anneken et al. (2025) further emphasize the need for ethical guidelines, yet their focus is not tailored to Japan's defense needs \citep{Anneken2025EthicalCF}.

Our research aims to fill these gaps by providing a nuanced analysis of the integration of AI-driven autonomous systems in Japan's defense, considering both technological and ethical perspectives. This approach not only addresses the limitations of prior studies but also offers a comprehensive framework that can guide future policy and practice in this area.

\section{Open Questions for Feedback}
\label{sec:questions}

% This paragraph introduces the purpose of the open questions section.
This section aims to highlight unresolved issues and invite constructive feedback from peers to refine the research approach and address potential challenges.

% This paragraph lists methodological tradeoffs and seeks input on them.
One key methodological tradeoff involves balancing the depth of qualitative insights from expert interviews with the breadth of quantitative data from public surveys. How can we ensure that both data types are effectively integrated to provide a comprehensive analysis? Additionally, are there alternative data collection methods that could enhance the robustness of our findings?

% This paragraph discusses ethical dilemmas and seeks guidance on addressing them.
Ethical dilemmas are inherent in the deployment of AI in defense. How can we ensure that our research framework adequately addresses these concerns while aligning with societal values? What ethical guidelines should be prioritized in the context of military applications of AI?

% This paragraph encourages collaboration and invites critique on the proposed framework.
We welcome collaboration with experts in military technology, ethics, and public policy to refine our proposed framework. Are there specific areas within the framework that require further development or adjustment? How can we ensure that our policy recommendations are both actionable and sensitive to the complexities of defense strategies?
