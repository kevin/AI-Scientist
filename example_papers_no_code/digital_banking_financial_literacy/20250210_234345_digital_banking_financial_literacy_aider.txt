#### Your goal is to investigate the following idea: Evaluating and Enhancing Financial Literacy in Japan's Aging Population through Digital Banking.  
#### The proposed investigation is as follows: This study explores the impact of digital banking on financial literacy among Japan's elderly and tests interventions to enhance their digital skills. It will assess digital literacy levels, correlate them with digital banking usage, identify barriers, and implement pilot programs, such as workshops, to improve access. The research aims to provide actionable insights for banks to design inclusive services and inform policymakers on enhancing financial literacy initiatives..  
#### You are given a total of up to 10 research queries to complete the investigation. You do not need to use all 10.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of data objects you would like to gather.  
#### Modify and duplicate the example in `investigation.json` for each query.  
#### Change the `"Description"` field to describe the contents of the `"Data"` object you would like to have.  
#### Change the `"Exists"` and `"Source"` fields to indicate if the data should already exist (e.g., from a prior study or on the internet) or if it needs to be gathered from scratch as during this proposed research.  
#### Change the `"Phase"` and `"Purpose"` fields to explain if it is needed for the proposal justification (e.g., data showing the scale or impact of the problem, examples of similar successful research in other contexts, other statistics), or if it is needed for the actual investigation (can also be existing data or new data collection that needs to be sourced by the researcher but can't be done in just this proposal).  
#### Change the `"Query"` field to a query to search the literature with for the data ONLY if it exists and is needed for the proposal.  
#### Leave the other fields empty.  
#### For example, a data object can be table of yearly historical data, or simply a single fact from an article about the topic.  
#### Objects needed for the proposal should be limited to what can be found on Semantic Scholar, but otherwise you can propose any data object you think would be useful for the investigation.  
#### These will represent the content of your investigation proposal, e.g., for supporting the importance of the topic and for laying out the research plan of the actual investigation if it were to be conducted.  

To plan the list of data objects for the investigation, I will modify and duplicate the example in `investigation.json` for each query. Here are the proposed changes:

% This section will review key prior studies addressing digital literacy and banking among the elderly.
% It will include the following papers from the references:
% - Kanapathipillai et al. (2023) on digital banking adoption among Malaysian seniors.
% - Cunha et al. (2019) on multimedia intervention programs for elderly digital literacy.
% - Choudhary & Bansal (2022) on digital literacy training programs.
% - Yang & Chun (2024) on digital use education for the elderly.
% - Rodrigues et al. (2024) on smartphone practices for elderly in Brazil.

% The section will begin by discussing the general landscape of digital literacy programs, citing Cunha et al. (2019) and Choudhary & Bansal (2022) to highlight successful interventions and their limitations.

% Next, it will address specific challenges faced by the elderly in adopting digital banking, referencing Kanapathipillai et al. (2023) to discuss barriers such as performance expectancy and social influence.

% The section will then compare these studies to the current research, emphasizing the unique focus on Japan's elderly population and the integration of digital banking as a tool for financial literacy.

% Finally, it will conclude by identifying gaps in the existing literature, particularly the lack of comprehensive studies on digital banking's role in enhancing financial literacy among the elderly, setting the stage for the proposed investigation.

This research proposal investigates the impact of digital banking on financial literacy among Japan's elderly and tests interventions to enhance their digital skills. As Japan's population ages, enabling the elderly to use digital banking services is vital for their financial independence and inclusion. Barriers such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence impede adoption. This study will assess digital literacy levels, correlate them with digital banking usage, and implement pilot programs like workshops to improve access. By addressing these challenges, the research aims to provide insights for banks to design inclusive services and inform policymakers on enhancing financial literacy initiatives. Expected outcomes include improved digital literacy and banking usage among the elderly, contributing to their financial well-being and autonomy.

\section{Research Question \& Motivation}
\label{sec:intro}
% This paragraph introduces the research question and its relevance.
The primary research question of this study is: How can digital banking be leveraged to enhance financial literacy among Japan's aging population? This question is crucial as Japan faces a rapidly aging demographic, with a significant portion of the population being elderly. Ensuring that this demographic can effectively use digital banking services is vital for their financial independence and inclusion in the digital economy.

% This paragraph discusses the challenges and gaps in current knowledge.
The challenge lies in the fact that many elderly individuals encounter barriers such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, which hinder their adoption of digital banking services. Despite the growing importance of digital literacy, comprehensive studies focusing on the elderly in Japan are lacking, making this an understudied area \citep{Miwa2017ChangingPO}. Addressing this gap is essential to develop targeted interventions that can improve digital literacy and banking usage among the elderly.

% This paragraph highlights the potential impact of addressing the research question.
By answering this research question, the study aims to provide actionable insights for banks to design inclusive services and inform policymakers on enhancing financial literacy initiatives. The societal impact of this research could be significant, as it would contribute to the financial well-being and autonomy of Japan's elderly population, ultimately supporting their integration into the digital economy.

\section{Research Question \& Motivation}
\label{sec:intro}
The central research question of this study is: How can digital banking be utilized to improve financial literacy among Japan's elderly? This inquiry is particularly relevant as Japan's population is rapidly aging, with a substantial portion being elderly. Enabling this demographic to effectively use digital banking services is crucial for their financial independence and inclusion in the digital economy.

The difficulty lies in overcoming barriers such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, which impede the adoption of digital banking by the elderly. Despite the critical need for digital literacy, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies focusing on Japan's elderly, making this a largely overlooked area \citep{Miwa2017ChangingPO}. Addressing this gap is vital for developing targeted interventions to enhance digital literacy and banking usage among the elderly.

By tackling this research question, the study seeks to offer actionable insights for banks to create inclusive services and guide policymakers in improving financial literacy initiatives. The potential societal impact is significant, as it would enhance the financial well-being and autonomy of Japan's elderly, supporting their integration into the digital economy.

\label{sec:intro}
% This paragraph introduces the research question and its relevance.
The primary research question of this study is: How can digital banking be leveraged to enhance financial literacy among Japan's aging population? This question is crucial as Japan faces a rapidly aging demographic, with a significant portion of the population being elderly. Ensuring that this demographic can effectively use digital banking services is vital for their financial independence and inclusion in the digital economy.

% This paragraph discusses the challenges and gaps in current knowledge.
The challenge lies in the fact that many elderly individuals encounter barriers such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, which hinder their adoption of digital banking services. Despite the growing importance of digital literacy, comprehensive studies focusing on the elderly in Japan are lacking, making this an understudied area \citep{Miwa2017ChangingPO}. Addressing this gap is essential to develop targeted interventions that can improve digital literacy and banking usage among the elderly.

% This paragraph highlights the potential impact of addressing the research question.
By answering this research question, the study aims to provide actionable insights for banks to design inclusive services and inform policymakers on enhancing financial literacy initiatives.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
This section reviews key studies on digital literacy and banking among the elderly, highlighting both achievements and limitations. Kanapathipillai et al. (2023) explored digital banking adoption among Malaysian seniors, identifying barriers like performance expectancy and social influence. Similarly, Cunha et al. (2019) and Choudhary & Bansal (2022) examined digital literacy programs, noting their successes in improving skills but also their limitations in addressing deeper behavioral barriers.

Yang & Chun (2024) and Rodrigues et al. (2024) provided insights into digital education and smartphone practices for the elderly, respectively, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions. However, these studies often overlook the specific needs of Japan's elderly population, particularly in integrating digital banking as a tool for financial literacy.

The current research distinguishes itself by focusing on Japan's elderly and the unique challenges they face in digital banking adoption. While previous studies have laid the groundwork, they have not fully addressed the intersection of digital literacy and financial independence in this demographic. This gap underscores the need for targeted interventions and comprehensive studies, which this research aims to fulfill.

\section{Proposed Investigation}
\label{sec:investigation}
The proposed investigation aims to test the hypothesis that improving digital literacy among Japan's elderly can significantly enhance their adoption and effective use of digital banking services. The research objectives are to assess current digital literacy levels, analyze the correlation between digital literacy and digital banking usage, and evaluate the effectiveness of pilot programs designed to improve digital skills.

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to gather comprehensive data. Surveys will establish a baseline of digital literacy levels and analyze their correlation with digital banking usage. Qualitative interviews will provide deeper insights into the barriers faced by the elderly. Data will be sourced from a representative sample of Japan's elderly population, ensuring diversity in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status.

To ensure data reliability and validity, standardized assessment tools for digital literacy will be used, alongside validated survey instruments for measuring digital banking usage. Pilot programs, such as workshops, will be implemented to test interventions, with pre- and post-assessment to evaluate their effectiveness. Feedback from participants will be collected to refine the programs.

The novelty of this approach lies in its interdisciplinary nature, combining insights from digital literacy, gerontology, and financial services. By leveraging new datasets gathered from the investigation, the study aims to fill existing gaps in understanding the digital banking needs of the elderly.

If initial plans face challenges, alternative pathways include adjusting the scope of the pilot programs or exploring additional data sources, such as industry reports or international case studies, to supplement the findings. Flexibility in the research design will ensure that the study can adapt to unforeseen circumstances while maintaining its core objectives.
